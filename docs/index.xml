  <title>Sequen-C: A Multilevel Overview of Temporal Event Sequences</title>

  <description><![CDATA[ 





<p>My name is Vladimir Kukushkin. I’ve been working as a data analyst/data scientist for more than 10 years. A couple of years ago I heavily shifted to quantitative UX research area which turned into my passion. While eagerly trying to find some sources to read regarding this topic, I realized that there are not so many of them. That’s why I decided to write a series of posts towards quantitative UX research. Basically, it will be reviews of papers, books and other publications that I find insightful. I’d be happy to find here enthusiasts who are also interested in this domain.</p>
<p>Let me start our journal club with the most impressive paper related to clickstream visualizations I’ve ever read: <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2108.03043">Sequen-C: A Multilevel Overview of Temporal Event Sequences</a> by Jessica Magallanes, Tony Stone, Paul D. Morris, Suzanne Mason, Steven Wood, and Maria-Cruz Villa-Uriol.</p>
<p>The authors address two very common issues that any quantitative UX researcher encounters:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>Clickstream data often comprises multiple behavioral paths. Treating and visualizing it as a whole is incorrect and often leads to contradictory results.</li>
<li>Despite the fact that users follow certain (latent) scenarios, the ways they perform particular steps vary greatly: they may repeat the same steps multiple times, deviate from a scenario, or switch it. When analyzing such data, it’s hard to understand the patterns of repetition, deviation, and switching.</li>
</ol>
<p>In the paper, the authors describe an interactive visualization tool that tackles both these issues and provides a methodology they call Align-Score-Simplify.</p>
<section id="methodology" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="methodology">Methodology</h2>
<p>The first problem is addressed by applying (agglomerative) clustering. I’ll explain further why they chose this algorithm. The second problem is solved using their framework called Align-Score-Simplify.</p>
<section id="align" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="align">Align</h3>
<p>This part is the most elegant, amazing, and surprizing in the whole paper. They apply the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multiple_sequence_alignment">MSA algorithm (Multiple Sequence Alignment)</a> stemming from bioinformatics. Originally, it was created to align amino acids or nucleotides in DNA sequences to identify common subsequences across DNAs belonging to multiple species. But this is exactly one of the goals we pursue in clickstream data analysis.</p>

<p>Let <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> be the output of the MSA algorithm applied to a set of unique sequences <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S"> (the frequency of each path is denoted as <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_i">). They calculate the information score <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_j"> for each column <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j"> in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Clambda"> as a measure of the column’s impurity, somewhat similar to entropy but with some additional penalty for high amount of gaps:</p>

<p>where</p>
<ul>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A"> – the set of unique events in <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?A_j"> – the set of unique events in column <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?P_a"> – the probability of the event <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?a"> in column <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">,</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?G_j"> – is the count of gaps in column <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">.</li>
</ul>

<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="simplify">Simplify</h3>
<p>Once the <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_j"> score is calculated for each column <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?j">, we can treat each column that exceeds a certain threshold <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?I_%5Ctau"> as an event that prevails in this column, while all other columns might be collapsed as noise. As a result, we get a new table <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Calpha"> that simplifies the initial clickstream <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?S">, as shown in the image below.</p>

<p>Finally, we can granulate our clickstream representation using two axes:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>We can consider different clusters of the agglomerative clustering output tree <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T">. Now it’s clear why they preferred this clustering algorithm instead of, say, K-Means. Considering different levels of <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?T">, we obtain more/less homogeneous clusters. More homogeneous clusters provide better and clearer output of the MSA algorithm.</li>
<li><img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">. By varying <img src="https://latex.codecogs.com/png.latex?%5Ctau">, we can make the sequence visualization more/less coarse.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, we get the interface like this:</p>

<p>In the following sections, the authors discuss tuning the parameters of the framework. They also describe how they tested their tool on a couple of real-world datasets. The datasets are more related to process mining, so the event cardinality is low. This is much lower than what happens in product analytics. The paths are very structured with few deviations from the main flow. That’s why I’m skeptical about applying this framework to product analytics clickstream data. Additionally, it’s not clear how fast MSA would work with clickstream data.</p>
<p>Anyway, the idea of the paper and the framework are super interesting to me. It would be to implement this tool someday.</p>

<p>I’ve been working as a data scientist / data analyst over 10 years. The slash signifies that I typically work at the intersection of product analytics and data science, tackling problems that require advanced techniques like predictive analytics, causal inference, and building statistical models. My specialization is in user behavior analysis a.k.a. quantitative UX research or, more broadly, in analyzing sequential data. In addition to working as a data analyst, I played a key role in developing an open-source Python library <a href="https://doc.retentioneering.com/stable/doc/">retentioneering</a>, which aims to simplify research in this area.</p>
<p>In my view, this field deserves much more attention than it currently receives. While these analyses are more complex than traditional funnel or cohort analysis, quantitative UX provides a deeper understanding of how users interact with your product. It reveals insights such as:</p>
<ul>
<li>What drives users to churn, make purchases, subscribe, etc. (causal inference),</li>
<li>What segments users form (cluster analysis),</li>
<li>What caused unexpected behavior in dashboard charts (root cause analysis)</li>
<li>What distinguishes one user group from another, e.g.&nbsp;mobile VS desktop, AB-experiment groups, before and after release.</li>
</ul>
<p>These research questions are not an empty sound. Finding the answers helps identify product bottlenecks, understand what drives user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and ultimately improve your product. This is the core purpose of product analytics.</p>
<p>Given the lack of substantial literature on the subject, here I aim to collect and review papers, books, and publications that I find insightful.</p>
<p>Like how Sgt.&nbsp;Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band expanded horizons in music, I hope this journal club will attract data analysts and data scientists eager to broaden their understanding of these topics. The term “club” in the title reflects my wish to engage with enthusiasts and foster discussions around these fascinating subjects. <em> <br><br>♫ Music playing ♫<br> We’re Sgt.&nbsp;Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band<br> We hope you will enjoy the show<br> </em></p>
