The slash signifies that I typically work at the intersection of product analytics and data science, tackling problems that require advanced techniques like predictive analytics, causal inference, and building statistical models. My specialization is in user behavior analysis a.k.a. quantitative UX research or, more broadly, in analyzing sequential data. In addition to working as a data analyst, I played a key role in developing an open-source Python library retentioneering, which aims to simplify research in this area.\nIn my view, this field deserves much more attention than it currently receives. While these analyses are more complex than traditional funnel or cohort analysis, quantitative UX provides a deeper understanding of how users interact with your product. It reveals insights such as:\n\nWhat drives users to churn, make purchases, subscribe, etc. (causal inference),\nWhat segments users form (cluster analysis),\nWhat caused unexpected behavior in dashboard charts (root cause analysis)\nWhat distinguishes one user group from another, e.g. mobile VS desktop, AB-experiment groups, before and after release.\n\nThese research questions are not an empty sound. Finding the answers helps identify product bottlenecks, understand what drives user satisfaction or dissatisfaction, and ultimately improve your product. This is the core purpose of product analytics.\nGiven the lack of substantial literature on the subject, here I aim to collect and review papers, books, and publications that I find insightful.\nLike how Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band expanded horizons in music, I hope this journal club will attract data analysts and data scientists eager to broaden their understanding of these topics. The term “club” in the title reflects my wish to engage with enthusiasts and foster discussions around these fascinating subjects.  ♫ Music playing ♫ We’re Sgt. Pepper’s Lonely Hearts Club Band We hope you will enjoy the show"

    "text": "My name is Vladimir Kukushkin. I’ve been working as a data analyst/data scientist for more than 10 years. A couple of years ago I heavily shifted to quantitative UX research area which turned into my passion. While eagerly trying to find some sources to read regarding this topic, I realized that there are not so many of them. That’s why I decided to write a series of posts towards quantitative UX research. Basically, it will be reviews of papers, books and other publications that I find insightful. I’d be happy to find here enthusiasts who are also interested in this domain.\nLet me start our journal club with the most impressive paper related to clickstream visualizations I’ve ever read: Sequen-C: A Multilevel Overview of Temporal Event Sequences by Jessica Magallanes, Tony Stone, Paul D. Morris, Suzanne Mason, Steven Wood, and Maria-Cruz Villa-Uriol.\nThe authors address two very common issues that any quantitative UX researcher encounters:\nIn the paper, the authors describe an interactive visualization tool that tackles both these issues and provides a methodology they call Align-Score-Simplify."

    "text": "Methodology\nThe first problem is addressed by applying (agglomerative) clustering. I’ll explain further why they chose this algorithm. The second problem is solved using their framework called Align-Score-Simplify.\n\nAlign\nThis part is the most elegant, amazing, and surprizing in the whole paper. They apply the MSA algorithm (Multiple Sequence Alignment) stemming from bioinformatics. Originally, it was created to align amino acids or nucleotides in DNA sequences to identify common subsequences across DNAs belonging to multiple species. But this is exactly one of the goals we pursue in clickstream data analysis.\n\n\n\n\nInserting - as gaps to align events in sequences. The coloured events might be considered as common at some steps. The others are considered as noise.\n\n\n\n\n\nScore\nLet \\(\\lambda\\) be the output of the MSA algorithm applied to a set of unique sequences \\(S\\) (the frequency of each path is denoted as \\(P_i\\)). They calculate the information score \\(I_j\\) for each column \\(j\\) in \\(\\lambda\\) as a measure of the column’s impurity, somewhat similar to entropy but with some additional penalty for high amount of gaps:\n\\[\nI_j = 1 - \\frac{E_j}{\\log_2(|A| + 1)}, \\;\\;\\;\\; E_j = \\sum_{a\\in A_j\\cup\\{-\\}}\n\\begin{cases}\n-P_a\\log_2\\left(\\frac{P_a}{G_j}\\right)\\, & \\text{if } a = \\text{'-'}\\\\\n-P_a\\log_2 P_a, & \\text{otherwise},\n\\end{cases}\n\\]\nwhere\n\n\\(A\\) – the set of unique events in \\(S\\),\n\\(A_j\\) – the set of unique events in column \\(j\\),\n\\(P_a\\) – the probability of the event \\(a\\) in column \\(j\\),\n\\(G_j\\) – is the count of gaps in column \\(j\\).\n\n\n\nSimplify\nOnce the \\(I_j\\) score is calculated for each column \\(j\\), we can treat each column that exceeds a certain threshold \\(I_\\tau\\) as an event that prevails in this column, while all other columns might be collapsed as noise. As a result, we get a new table \\(\\alpha\\) that simplifies the initial clickstream \\(S\\), as shown in the image below.\n\n\n\n\nThe outline of the Align-Score-Simplify workflow.\n\n\n\nFinally, we can granulate our clickstream representation using two axes:\n\nWe can consider different clusters of the agglomerative clustering output tree \\(T\\). Now it’s clear why they preferred this clustering algorithm instead of, say, K-Means. Considering different levels of \\(T\\), we obtain more/less homogeneous clusters. More homogeneous clusters provide better and clearer output of the MSA algorithm.\n\\(\\tau\\). By varying \\(\\tau\\), we can make the sequence visualization more/less coarse.\n\nAs a result, we get the interface like this:\n\n\n\n\nThe outline of the whole framework. (A) Building aggregate tree \\(T\\) for input unique sequences \\(S = \\{s_1, ...s_6\\}\\). (B) Each node in \\(T\\) has an alignment matrix \\(\\lambda\\) for its child sequences, a row-wise probabilities vector \\(P\\), and a column-wise information score vector \\(I\\). Two or more consecutive columns in \\(\\lambda\\) with \\(I_j &lt; 0.8\\) are not coloured. (C) Multilevel overviews for a range of number of clusters \\(k\\) retrieved from \\(T\\), where black blocks represent merged columns. Image by authors.\n\n\n\nIn the following sections, the authors discuss tuning the parameters of the framework. They also describe how they tested their tool on a couple of real-world datasets. The datasets are more related to process mining, so the event cardinality is low. This is much lower than what happens in product analytics. The paths are very structured with few deviations from the main flow. That’s why I’m skeptical about applying this framework to product analytics clickstream data. Additionally, it’s not clear how fast MSA would work with clickstream data.\nAnyway, the idea of the paper and the framework are super interesting to me. It would be great to implement such a tool someday."
