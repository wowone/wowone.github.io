<p>When I started my journey as a quantitative UX researcher, I was looking for literature that could provide me with a solid foundation in this area. The book <a href="https://quantuxbook.com/">Quantitative User Experience Research</a> by Chris Chapman and Kerry Rodden seemed to be a perfect fit for this purpose. Today I’d like to share my thoughts on this book.</p>
<section id="general-impression" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="general-impression">General impression</h2>
<p>Both authors are Ph.D.&nbsp;researchers with extensive experience in the industry. Chris Chapman is a psychologist, currently working as a a Principal UX Researcher at Amazon Lab126. You may be aware of his other books “R for Marketing Research and Analytics” and “Python for Marketing”. Kerry Rodden a Senior Principal Researcher at Code for America previously worked at Google and founded the quantitative UX research role there. Probably you’ve heard about HEART metrics framework, so he’s the one who introduced it. As you can see, the authors have a solid background in the field.</p>
<p>Generally speaking, the book is a good starting point for those who want to dive into quantitative UX research. It covers a wide range of topics, from overview of the field to practical advice on how to conduct research. However, I found the general parts too general while practical parts turned out to be too shallow for me. Perhaps, it’s because I already have some experience in product analytics, but I expected to get more interesting insights and practical tips from the book. I was quite upset when the authors said that this or that aspect is out of the scope of the book. Come on, this is what I expected to see here! Nevertherless, it was good to refresh some basics, follow the authors’ narrative, get some new ideas and references.</p>
<p>The only part I’d like to focus on, part III, relates to some practical aspects of quantitative UX research. The other parts represent rather a big picture of the field and seemed not interesting to me, e.g.&nbsp;state of the art, introduction to statistics and programming (that was especially surprising for me: just a single chapter for such broad topics), career advices, etc.</p>
</section>
<section id="part-iii.-tools-and-techniques" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="part-iii.-tools-and-techniques">Part III. Tools and Techniques</h2>
<p>The part consists of 4 chapters. I’ll briefly summarize each of them sharing my thoughts on them.</p>
<section id="chapter-7-metrics-of-user-experience" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-7-metrics-of-user-experience">Chapter 7 “Metrics of User Experience”</h3>
<p>This chapter is mostly devoted to the HEART framework: Happiness, Engagement, Adoption, Retention, Task success. It’s a well-known topic, there are many articles on this everywhere (for example, see <a href="https://research.google/pubs/measuring-the-user-experience-on-a-large-scale-user-centered-metrics-for-web-applications/">Kerry’s original paper</a>), so I won’t go into details here. Their example of how the framework was applied to Gmail when the labels feature was introduced in 2009 is good (actually it’s a summary of <a href="https://research.google/pubs/best-of-both-worlds-improving-gmail-labels-with-the-affordances-of-folders/">another Kerry’s paper</a>), but besides that, there’s nothing practical more in this chapter. Unfortunately.</p>
<p>Funny fact. From this chapter, I finally understood how Gmail labels work. Yes, I still sort emails into folders in old-fashioned way, but I will stop doing this now, I promise. It turned out that, as a Gmail user, it took me 15 years to adopt this feature.</p>
</section>
<section id="chapter-8-customer-satisfaction-surveys" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-8-customer-satisfaction-surveys">Chapter 8 “Customer Satisfaction Surveys”</h3>
<p>This chapter is devoted to some practical aspects of Customer Satisfaction surveys (CSat) analysis. Since I rarely deal with surveys in my work, I was curious to extend my knowledge in this area.</p>
<p>The most surprising fact for me was that the Net Promoter Score (NPS) is far away from being <a href="https://hbr.org/2003/12/the-one-number-you-need-to-grow">“the one number you need to grow”</a> as it was claimed by Frederick F. Reichheld. As a data analyst, I could expect that obviously one number can’t be enough to describe the whole customer satisfaction, but now I can’t understand why it’s still so popular.</p>
<p>The chapter is provided with a nice and reproducible (code + dataset) example of how to analyze survey data using R. The most interesting part here was yet another example of Simpson’s paradox. The authors showed a declining trend for CSat for a product rolled out in the US and Germany while the same CSat metric was flat for the US and increasing for Germany. The reason, as you may have guessed, was in the different distribution of responses in these countries: the US respondents gave higher scores on average and their share was decreasing over time.</p>
<p>Finally, the following couple of quotes is worth to be mentioned, no comments needed.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>It is common for CSat to remain constant for an be perplexed by this and ask, “We released great feature X! Why isn’t CSat going up?” There are many possible answers to this, but two fundamental ones are that customers don’t care as much as you do about your features; and respondents often answer such questions with a high-level brand evaluation, which changes slowly. Also, when a product is performing well, an unchanging rating is a good thing. The important thing is to use CSat as an indicator of health.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Stakeholders often want to know which factors lead to or “drive” CSat. This is often approached with a large survey and a regression model to look for predictors of CSat; see Chapter 7 in <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-14316-9">25</a> or in <a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-030-49720-0">127</a>. Unfortunately, such data often has high collinearity (correlation among items) that makes statistical modeling difficult or impossible. We largely recommend to avoid such efforts and to focus on qualitative assessment of reasons for satisfaction or dissatisfaction. If you decide to pursue driver analysis, you’ll want to investigate collinearity and dimensional reduction (discussed in Section 8.6). This involves iterative research to understand relationships in the data and build models that isolate and estimate the important effects.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>However, I’m curious why correlation among items seems to be a problem. Some models, such as decision trees or its modifications, should handle correlated features well.</p>
</section>
<section id="chapter-9-log-sequence-visualization" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-9-log-sequence-visualization">Chapter 9 “Log Sequence Visualization”</h3>
<p>I won’t lie if I say that I started reading this book because of this chapter mostly. I know how difficult it is to visualize user behavior data, so I was hoping to get some new ideas. In a nutshell, the only approach the authors demonstrate here is a sunburst diagram. I heard about it later but I’ve never used it in my work, so the comprehensive and reproducible example (again, with R code and a dataset, many thanks to the authors) was quite helpful.</p>
<p>However, plenty of other visualizations and approaches were not even mentioned even in “Learning more” subsection (look at <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0097849323000717">this overwhelming survey</a> for example). I was disappointed. On the other hand, this strengthened my belief that I should keep reviewing papers and writing about them here.</p>
</section>
<section id="chapter-10-maxdiff-prioritizing-features-and-user-needs" class="level3">
<h3 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="chapter-10-maxdiff-prioritizing-features-and-user-needs">Chapter 10 “MaxDiff: Prioritizing Features and User Needs”</h3>
<p>Yet another promising chapter that my eye caught. The problem that I solve occasionally as a product analyst is how to rank product features according to user preferences. Whereas I basically work with event logs and try to interpret user behavior as a signal of satisfaction, the authors describe an approach based on survey data. The idea of the MaxDiff method is to ask respondents a simple question like “Which item engages you MOST LIKELY and LEAST LIKELY?” for a set of items split into multiple smaller sets. Applying some math, you can get a preference score for each item along with the corresponding confidence interval. As a result, you can not only rank the items but also estimate the significance of the differences between them.</p>
<p>The chapter provides a step-by-step guide on how to conduct such a survey and a lot of practical advice. As usual, a reproducible example with R code and a dataset is included. Frankly speaking, I didn’t dive into all the details but now I definitely know where to look for them when I need them.</p>

<section id="personal-notes" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="personal-notes">Personal notes</h2>

<p>Which area should you emphasize? It depends on your skills and interests! Beyond that, we have one suggestion: in recent years we have observed that the survey area is in particularly high demand and often outstrips the available skills of Quant UXRs. <strong>Page 51</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>To pose a single question, ask yourself whether you prefer to work with more nebulous, open-ended, primary research problems centered on users—with a substantial chance of any project failing—or you prefer more structured, clearer projects where success consists of improving tools, processes, and reports used by executive stakeholders. The former aligns better with Quant UXR, whereas the latter aligns with analyst positions. <strong>Page 56</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>For social scientists, and especially psychologists, Chris has elsewhere described how skills in human research are advantageous for the activities and needs of general UX research [17]. For statisticians, Tim Hesterberg has outlined common projects, job opportunities, and ways to learn more about roles for statisticians at Google [59]. <strong>Page 61</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>If you conclude that your interests align best with general UX research, an excellent guide to descriptive and basic inferential statistics for UX is Sauro and Lewis, Quantifying the User Experience [124]. Note that Quant UX roles expect a higher level of skill in statistics and experimental design than their book describes. <strong>Page 62</strong></p>

<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Conjoint analysis: An introduction to conjoint analysis in R is given in the R companion text [25]. Bryan Orme has written a less technical introduction with extensive guidance for practitioners and research managers [106]. <strong>Page 62</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>In-product and online surveys: A common mistake with surveys is asking what you want to know—instead of what respondents are able to tell you [20]. Too many surveys are not planned well, written well, or pre-tested. Jarrett’s Surveys That Work [63] is a practical guide that emphasizes careful consideration of the decisions you might take according to survey results, and then designing appropriate research plans and items to inform those decisions. More detailed guidance and a comprehensive summary of empirically-based recommendations is Callegaro et al., Web Survey Methodology [12]. If you do many surveys, we recommend that you learn about scale development and psychometrics generally; DeVellis’s Scale Development [39] is an outstanding, approachable introduction. <strong>Page 63</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Experience sampling: These methods range from almost exclusively qualitative approaches, such as diary studies, to longitudinal structural models. A good introduction is Silvia and Cotter, Researching Daily Life [133]. Bolger and Laurenceau [7] discuss technical methods for analysis of longitudinal within-person events and responses, with code for many examples available in R as well as SAS, SPSS, Mplus, and HLM. <strong>Page 64</strong></p>

</blockquote>
<p>Good chapter. Worth reading.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unfortunately, the incentives in industry research too often lead to inadequate research planning, short timelines, excessive optimism, and rewards for delivering what stakeholders want to hear. Simultaneously there is little appreciation of research quality, especially when it delivers an unwanted answer. This situation can trap even the most earnest and well-intentioned researchers unless they take care to remain diligent about research quality. <strong>Page 74</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Chris and his colleagues have written about other examples that overpromise and have weak scientific bases, including personas (fictional descriptions of users) and the Kano method (a two-item survey that promises to indicate the strategic priority of product features) [24] <strong>Page 75</strong></p>

<p>Meanwhile, we emphasize this general point: the most important aspects of statistical analysis occur before any data are collected, when you decide on the details of the experimental design. <strong>Page 97</strong></p>

<p>There is a relevant, famous quote from the statistician John Tukey, “The combination of some data and an aching desire for an answer does not ensure that a reasonable answer can be extracted from a given body of data.” [143]. <strong>Page 99</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Those of us who work with data often become caught up in the excitement of understanding users, and stakeholders often share the view that the goal of UX research is to understand users. We believe this is admirable but incorrect; our task is to help stakeholders to make decisions about products. <strong>Page 99</strong></p>

<p>At the time of the launch, there was an increased incidence of undo-like actions associated with labeling (e.g., removing a label immediately after it was added), perhaps indicating that users were making more errors. This quickly returned to its previous level, so there was no cause for concern. <strong>Page 136</strong></p>

<p>Our general feeling is that using NPS invites many more problems than it solves, and a standard CSat score is preferable. In a situation where an executive demands an NPS score and will not budge from that demand, we might go ahead and use it. (To be honest, we also try not to work with stakeholders who devalue our expertise and wish to dictate methods.) <strong>Page 151</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>be cautious about committing to a “product-like” delivery of results, such as a dashboard or automation into a data warehouse. The problem with those commitments is that initial enthusiasm will turn into a long-term demand for support, even if key stakeholders lose interest. We always say that we would prefer to do new research than to be dashboard engineers. This is not to discount or dismiss the importance of reporting mechanisms. Rather, you should consider carefully whether maintenance of a dashboard or data warehouse would be of interest to you or maximize your value to the organization. <strong>Page 155</strong></p>

<p>Yeah, that’s a data analyst’s life.</p>
<blockquote class="blockquote">
<p>Unchanging ratings: It is common for CSat to remain constant for an extended time period. Designers, PMs, and other stakeholders may be perplexed by this and ask, “We released great feature X!

<p>Can the pages be grouped into meaningful, higher-order categories? There may be collections of pages that have different URLs but represent very similar user actions or intentions, and could therefore be collapsed into the same category. For example, we could replace the full URL path with a category name such as [search] or [materials]. Such choices are dependent on the goals of the analysis and a detailed understanding of the data. When done well, categorization makes a sunburst diagram clearer and less cluttered [115] <strong>Page 193</strong></p>

<p>too many researchers are hesitant to communicate what they really believe and use vague words to couch everything in statistician speak. This leads to statements such as, “The data in this sample show a trend that is consistent with many users showing interest in X, p &lt; 0.10.” Don’t do that!

<p>Another risk for a tech lead is being asked to take a dual role that combines management alongside IC work.

Our view is that this often does not turn out as expected. It frequently becomes a situation in which either the IC work is abandoned under the pressures of immediate management or the TL is required to work much longer every week. <strong>Page 337</strong></p>

<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>If you’re a beginner in quantitative UX research I definitely recommend this book. For more experienced researchers, this may only be useful if you’re interested in exploring the HEART framework, sunburst diagrams, specific survey techniques (such as customer satisfaction surveys and MaxDiff), or gaining a basic understanding of the work of a quantitative UX researcher. The book is well-structured, easy to read, and provides a lot of references for further reading. Some of them I’ll take to my reading list:</p>
