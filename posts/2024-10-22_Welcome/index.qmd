My name is Vladimir Kukushkin. I've been working more than 10 years as a data analyst / data scientist. The slash sign means here that I usually deal with product analytics problems requiring data science techniques, like predictive analytics, causal inference, building statistical models, etc. In particular, I specialize in user behavior analysis a.k.a. quantitative UX research or, more general, in any sequential data analysis. Besides working on these problems as a data analyst, I played major roles in developing retentioneering open-source Python library aimig to facilitate this type of researches.

In my humble opinion, undeservably little attention is payed to this area. Even though such researches are quite sophisticated compared to traditional funnel or cohort analysis, a deep dive into Quant UX sheds the light onto real understanding how your product's users behave. In particular:

- What drives them to churn/purchase/subscription/etc. (causal inference),
- What clusters the users form (cluster analysis),
- What caused some unexpected behavior that was captured by our dashboard charts (root cause analysis).

And since there's not much literature devoted to this topic, I'm going to carefully collect and review any papers, books, and publications that would seem interesting to me.

Just like Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band has expanded the horizons of perceptions, I will be glad if this journal club attracts the attention of dat aanalysts and data scientists and helps expand their horizons too. And yes, "club" in the title means that I hope to find here some enthusiasts and discuss with them any aspects of these topics.
